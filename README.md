This game is my entry for the Safe in Our World Mental Health game jam.
The game will feature a story based on some of my own personal challenges in the form of an action adventure game inspired by Bloodborne and Resident Evil, exploring fear of the unknown, the stigmas of being goth, and isolation.
My goal for this game jam is to create a vertical slice of the game that can be used as a demo.
